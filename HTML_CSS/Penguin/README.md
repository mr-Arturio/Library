In this course from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-css-transforms-by-building-a-penguin/step-1), we built a penguin. We used ```CSS transforms``` to position and resize the parts of your penguin, create a background, and animate our work.<br>
You can transform HTML elements to create appealing designs that draw your reader's eye. You can use transforms to rotate elements, scale them, and more.
